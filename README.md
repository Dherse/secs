# Static Entity Component System (SECS)

SECS is a high performance statically generated ECS that uses configuration files to generate all of the ECS code. This allows the code to be purposefully written for the specific requirements of your project, removing the need for dynamic dispatch and runtime computation. Everything is done at compile time using a build file.
